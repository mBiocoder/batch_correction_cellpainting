Atopic dermatitis is a skin condition characterized by redness, itching, scaling and inflammation of the skin. The cause of atopic dermatitis is not known; however, scientists believe that it may be due to activation of the immune system by various environmental or emotional triggers. Scientists do not know exactly how pimecrolimus reduces the manifestations of atopic dermatitis, but pimecrolimus reduces the action of T-cells and mast cells which are part of the immune system and contribute to responses of the immune system. Pimecrolimus prevents the activation of T-cells by blocking the effects of chemicals (cytokines) released by the body that stimulate T-cells. Pimecrolimus also reduces the ability of mast cells to release chemicals that promote inflammation.","Pimecrolimus binds with high affinity to macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12) and inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. As a consequence, it inhibits T cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. In particular, pimecrolimus inhibits at nanomolar concentrations Interleukin-2 and interferon gamma (Th1-type) and Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 (Th2-type) cytokine synthesis in human T cells. Also, pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen/lgE.","Side effects include burning sensation, irritation, pruritus, erythema, and skin infections, at the application site.","No drug metabolism was observed in human skin in vitro.

Nabumetone was developed by Smithkline Beecham under the trade name Relafen and first received FDA approval in December, 1991.[L6568]","228.115029756","Other antiinflammatory and antirheumatic agents, non-steroids","ANTIINFLAMMATORY AND ANTIRHEUMATIC PRODUCTS, NON-STEROIDS","ANTIINFLAMMATORY AND ANTIRHEUMATIC PRODUCTS","MUSCULO-SKELETAL SYSTEM","**Indicated** for:[label]

1) Symptomatic relief in rheumatoid arthritis.

2) Symptomatic relief in osteoarthritis.","NSAIDs, like nabumetone, are well established as analgesics. NSAIDs reduce both peripheral and central sensitization of nociceptive neurons due to inflammation which contribute to hyperalgesia and allodynia.[T116,A179023] This sensitization occurs through reducing the action potential threshold in peripheral neurons, reducing the intensity of painful stimuli needed to produce a painful sensation. Centrally, activation of dorsal horn neurons occurs along with increased release of glutamate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P which increase the transmission of painful stimuli. Coupled with this is an inhibition glycinergic neurons which normally inhibit pain transmission, a phenomenon known as disinhibition. Increased activity ofn-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors leads to the establishment of central sensitization, allowing both mild painful and innocuous stimuli to produce action potentials in nociceptive projection neurons. NSAIDs are effective in reducing mild-moderate acute and chronic nociceptive pain, however, the usefulness of NSAIDs in neuropathic pain is limited.

The anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs is mediated by preventing vasodilation, increases in vascular permeability, and the release of cytokines from endothelial cells.[T116,A179044] These three effects together prevent immunocompetent cells from migrating to the site of injury thereby preventing additional damage and inflammation due to activation of the immune system at the site of damage. PGs also modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation, an activity which is thought to be of importance in arthritic conditions.

The anti-pyretic effect of NSAIDs is mediated through preventing increases in temperature by prostaglandins (PGs) via the hypothalamus.[T116] Activation of this process by other inflammatory mediators relies upon subsequent action by PGs, therefore NSAIDs are able to reduce fever due to these mediators as well.

The adverse effects of NSAIDs are related to their therapeutic effects.[T116] The same vasodilatory action which occurs in inflammation also serves to regulate blood flow to the kidneys through the afferent renal arteries. NSAIDs are widely known as nephrotoxic agents as the reduction in PGs produces vasoconstriction of these arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the kidneys and a subsequent decline in renal function. Reductions in mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion in the stomach increases the risk of ulceration by limiting the protection mediated by PGs. Lastly, COX-2 selective agents like nabumetone can unbalance prothrombotic and antithrombotic prostanoid generation leading to increased platelet aggregation and increased risk of thrombosis.","Nabumetone's active metabolite, 6-MNA, is an inhibitor of both COX-1 and COX-2 although it exhibits some COX-2 selectivity.[label,A178903] Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 reduces conversion of arachidonic acid to PGs and thromboxane (TXA<sub>2</sub>). This reduction in prostanoid production is the common mechanism that mediates the effects of nambutone.

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.

PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.

PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

The adverse effects of NSAIDs stem from the protective and regulatory roles of prostanoids which have been well-characterized.[T116] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> regulate blood flow to the kidney by similar mechanisms to the vasodilation they produce in inflammation. Prevention of this regulation by NSAIDs produces vasoconstriction which limits renal function by reducing blood flow and the hydrostatic pressure which drives filtration. PGE<sub>2</sub> also regulates gastric protection via EP<sub>3</sub> receptors which are, in this location, coupled to G<sub>i</sub> which inhibits the AC/PKA pathway. This reduces the secretion of protons by H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase in parietal cells and increases the secretion of mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by superficial endothelial cells. Disruption of this protective action by NSAIDs lead to ulceration of the gastric mucosa. Lastly, disruption of PGI<sub>2</sub>, which opposes platelet aggregation, generation by COX-2 selective agents leads to an imbalance with TXA<sub>2</sub> generated by COX-1, which promotes aggregation of platelets, leading to increased risk of thrombosis. Since nabumetone is somewhat COX-2 selective it is thought to promote this imbalance and increase thrombotic risk.[A178903]","**LD<sub>50</sub> Values**

**Overdose**

Signs and symptoms of nabumetone overdose include lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain.[label] These are considered reversible with supportive care. GI bleeding, hypertension, acute kidney injury, respiratory depression, and coma are rare but can occur. No antidote exists for nabumetone overdose although administration of activated charcoal and/or induction of emesis can reduce absorption if the nabumetone dose was taken less than 4 hours prior.[label,L6466] 6-MNA is cannot be cleared by dialysis.

**Carcinogenicity & Mutagenicity**

Nabumetone was not significantly carcinogenic in rats or mice studied over 2 years.[label] Neither the Ames test nor mouse micronucleus test showed nabumetone or it's active metabolite, 6-MNA, to be mutagenic. Chromosomal abberation has been observed in cultured lymphocytes exposed to concentrations of 80 mcg/mL and higher of nabumetone or 6-MNA equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose.

**Reproductive Toxicity**

No adverse effects on fertility have been observed in male and female rats at doses of 320 mg/kg/day.[label,L6466]] No teratogenicity has been observed in pregnant rabbits or rats. Dystocia and delayed parturition have been noted in rats resulting in reduced survival of offspring. This has been attributed to the role of prostaglandins in uterine contraction. NSAIDs can also cause premature closure of the ductus ateriosus.

However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]

The main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]","473.166079047","Selective estrogen receptor modulators","OTHER SEX HORMONES AND MODULATORS OF THE GENITAL SYSTEM","SEX HORMONES AND MODULATORS OF THE GENITAL SYSTEM","GENITO URINARY SYSTEM AND SEX HORMONES","Indicated for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, as well as prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced bone loss.[label]

Indicated for the reduction in the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or postmenopausal women with a high risk for invasive breast cancer.[label]","Raloxifene belongs to the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) drug class that exhibits estrogenic effects on bone and lipid metabolism while mediating anti-estrogenic effects on uterine endometrium and breast tissues.[A4977] On skeletal tissues, raloxifene stimulates bone-depositing osteoblasts and inhibits bone-resorbing osteoclasts[T28] to augument bone mineral density.[A4977] Raloxifene produces estrogen-like effects on bone, reducing the resorption of bone and increasing bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, thus slowing the rate of bone loss.[label] In three randomized, placebo-controlled trials in Europe, postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene at variable doses of 30 to 150 mg daily demonstrated significant increases in bone mineral density in the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and total body compared to placebo.[A4977] In the MORE and RUTH trials, there were fewer incidences of vertebral fractures in postmeopausal women receiving raloxifene compared to placebo.[A4979] In a eight-week study evaluating short-term effects of raloxifene in healthy postmenopausal women, there was a decrease in the bone turnover markers, such as serum alkaline phosphatase level, serum osteocalcin level and urinary calcium excretion.[A4977] 

Raloxifene was shown to inhibit estrogen-dependent proliferation of human breast cancer cells _in vitro_ and development of induced mammary tumors in rats _in vivo_.[A721] In adult female rats, raloxifene produced a greater regression of the mammary gland than [tamoxifen].[A721] The MORE trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial that investigated the long-term effects of the drug therapy in European and American postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene for 40 months.[A719] Additionally, a reduction in the incidence of invasive breast cancer was also demonstrates in the CORE and RUTH trials.[A4979] Study findings demonstrated that compared to placebo, the risk of invasive breast cancer was decreased by 76% among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. There was a decrease in the risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 90% but there was no increase in the risk of endometrial cancer. Unlike hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene does not mediate proliferative or stimulatory effects on endometrial tissue. Findings from both animal and human studies demonstrated no significant changes in the histologic appearance of the endometrium.[A4977]

Raloxifene promotes estrogen-like effects on lipid metabolism. In a European trial that evaluated lipid profiles following raloxifene therapy over the 24-month period, there were significant decreases in the serum concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol over a 24-month period of raloxifene therapy.[A4977] Raloxifene is not associated with causing alterations in the serum levels of HDL cholesterol or triglycerides.[A4977] As the HDL choesterol level is considered a strong inverse predictor of cardiovascular disease in women, the cardioprotective effects of raloxifene were questioned. Due to limited data on the long-term trials, it is not possible to determine whether the small lipid effects produced by raloxifene correlate with a smaller degree of cardioprotective activity compared with hormone replacement therapy.[A4977] ","Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as both an estrogen agonist and antagonist via differential effects on the tissue-specific estrogen receptors. Based on the findings of competitive binding assays, raloxifene displays binding affinity that is similar to that of [estradiol][A721], the predominant circulating estrogen.[A178861] Estrogens play variable roles at different tissues in females, including the bone, breasts, uterus and liver, by binding to the steroid nuclear hormone receptors, Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) or Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ).[A178861] These receptors are normally bound to the Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) when unbound to the ligand. Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that promotes dissociation of the receptor from Hsp90, dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. This movement into the nucleus allows the receptor to bind to genomic locations based on sequence recognition of the DNA binding domain, also known as the Estrogen Response Elements (EREs).[A178861] 

In bones, endogenous estrogens normally modulate multiple DNA response elements, including the gene-encoding transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3), which is a cytokine embedded in the bone matrix.[T28] TGF-β3 plays an important role in bone remodelling[A178756] by working with other cytokines to induce production of osteoblasts, such as IL-6[A720], and attenuate the activity of osetoclasts. Estrogens typically maintain the bone integrity by inhibiting the cytokines that recruit osteoclasts and oppose the bone-resorbing, Ca2+-mobilizing action of parathyroid hormone. In contrast, estrogens promote osteoblast proliferation, augment the production of TGF-β3 and bone morphogenic proteins, and inhibit apoptosis.[T28] Mimicking the action of endogenous estrogen in bone tissues, raloxifene binds to the estrogen receptor to influence gene transcription through interactions with the estrogen response element (ERE) and a distinct DNA target, the raloxifene response element (RRE).[A722] It occupies the same ER ligand binding site as estrogen.[A724] Upon binding, raloxifene induces a conformational change of the receptor, allowing mediation of direct binding to transcriptional elements by accessory proteins. Increased expression of bone matrix proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, osteocalcin and collagen may be seen.[A722] The agonistic or antagonistic action of raloxifene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promotors.[label] In breast tissues, raloxifene acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist to attenuate the estrogen-dependent proliferative effects of epithelial cell expansion. In addition to the antiproliferative effects, raloxifene prevents the production of cytokines and recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes into tumor mass.[A178921]","**LD<sub>50</sub> and Overdose**

The oral LD<sub>50</sub> value in rats is > 5000 mg/kg, which is about 810 times the human dose.[MSDS] In monkeys, no mortality was seen after a single oral dose of 1000 mg/kg.[label] No cases of raloxifene overdose have been reported during clinical trials. A rare postmarketing report of a non-fatal overdose after oral ingestion of 1.5 g has been reported. Common adverse events of leg cramps, hot flushes, and dizziness have been reported with the use of raloxifene at doses of greater than 180 mg. More serious adverse event of venous thromboembolic events were observed with raloxifene.[A721] Two 18-month-old children accidentally ingested 180 mg of raloxifene and symptoms of ataxia, dizziness, vomiting, rash, diarrhea, tremor, flushing, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were reported. There is no known antidote for raloxifene. [label] 

**Nonclinical Toxicology**

In a two-year mouse carcinogenicity study at raloxifene doses that are higher than the human therapeutic doses, there was an increased incidence of benign and malignant ovarian tumors of granulosa or theca cell origin. Another study showed an increased incidence of testicular interstitial cell tumors, prostatic adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and prostatic leiomyoblastoma in male mice receiving doses higher than human therapeutic doses. There was no evidence of the genotoxic potential of raloxifene in bacterial mutagenicity assays, _in vitro_ rat DNA assays, or other _in vitro_ rodent cell line assays. When assessing effects on the reproductive system of male and female rats, raloxifene caused lack of pregnancy and disruptions in estrous cycles and inhibited ovulation at dose of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day. Administration of raloxifene during the preimplantation period at doses greater than 0.1 mg/kg resulted in delayed and disrupted embryo implantation, further leading to prolonged gestation and reduced litter size. There were no effects on sperm production or quality or reproductive performance in male rats. The effects on the fertility by raloxifene were reversible.[label] 

**Use in special populations**

The use of raloxifene in pregnant or nursing women is not advised. Although there are no specific dosing adjustment guidelines, caution should be undertaken when administering raloxifene in geriatric patients or patients with renal or hepatic impairment.[label]","Raloxifene is reported to undergo metabolism in the intestines and liver devoid of cytochrome P450 pathway.[A4977] It is extensively metabolized, where less than 1% of the total dose exists as unchanged compound.[label] It mainly undergoes first-pass metabolism to form glucuronide conjugates, raloxifene-4'-glucuronide (raloxifene-4'-β-glucuronide), raloxifene-6-glucuronide (raloxifene-6-β-glucuronide), and raloxifene-6,4'-diglucuronide. No other metabolites have been detected in human plasma. The terminal log-linear portions of the plasma concentration curves for raloxifene and the glucuronides are generally parallel. This is consistent with interconversion of raloxifene and the glucuronide metabolites.[label]","Raloxifene is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with approximately 60% fo the drug being absorbed following oral administration.[T28] Due to the extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism that involves glucuronide conjugation, the absolute oral bioavailability of raloxifene is about 2%.[T28] Following oral ingestion of a single dose or multiple dose of raloxifen in healthy postmenopausal women, the mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 0.50 and 1.36 ng/mL, respectively, and the AUC values were 27.2 and 24.2 ngxhr/mL, respectively. The time to reach Cmax following a single or multiple oral doses were 27.7 and 32.5 hours, respectively.[label] Although not clinically significant, oral ingestion of raloxifene with high-fat meals is thought to increase the systemic bioavailability of the drug[A4977] by increasnig the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and AUC by 28% and 16%, respectively.[label]","The average plasma elimination half-life of raloxifene ranges from 27 to 32 hours.[A4977,T28] The prolonged half-life has been attributed to the drug's reversible systemic metabolism and significant enterohepatic cycling.[A4977]","About 95% of raloxifene and its glucuronide metabolites are bound to plasma proteins.[label] Although this is a relatively high protein binding profile, _in vitro_ studies suggest that raloxifene and its metabolites do not significantly interact with binding of highly protein-bound drugs.[A4977] FDA Label still advises patients to use raloxifene with caution co-administering with other highly protein-bound drugs.[label]","Raloxifene predominantly undergoes fecal excretion, with less than 0.2% of the dose being excreted in the urine as unchanged form of the compound and less than 6% of the dose being excreted as glucuronide conjugates. Co-administration with [cholestyramine], a bile acid sequestrant, was shown to reduce the enterohepatic recycling of raloxifene by 60%.[T28]","Following oral administration of single doses randing from 30 to 150 mg in postmenopausal women, the volume of distribution was about 2348 L/kg.

Miglitol should be taken at the start of a meal for maximal effect and the effect will depend on the amount of poly and oligosaccharides in the diet. Miglitol inhibits alpha-glucosidase, making less sugars available for digestion and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia.

INSULINS","DRUGS USED IN DIABETES","ALIMENTARY TRACT AND METABOLISM","For use as an adjunct to diet to improve glycemic control in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) whose hyperglycemia cannot be managed with diet alone.","Miglitol, an oral alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, is a desoxynojirimycin derivative that delays the digestion of ingested carbohydrates, thereby resulting in a smaller rise in blood glucose concentration following meals. As a consequence of plasma glucose reduction, miglitol reduce levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in patients with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Systemic nonenzymatic protein glycosylation, as reflected by levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, is a function of average blood glucose concentration over time. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of miglitol to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas when used in combination. In addition, miglitol diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Miglitol has minor inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently, at the recommended doses, would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.","In contrast to sulfonylureas, miglitol does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of miglitol results from a reversible inhibition of membrane-bound intestinal a-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Membrane-bound intestinal a-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in delayed glucose absorption and lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia.","Unlike sulfonylureas or insulin, an overdose will not result in hypoglycemia. An overdose may result in transient increases in flatulence, diarrhea, and abdomi-nal discomfort. Because of the lack of extra-intestinal effects seen with miglitol, no serious systemic reactions are expected in the event of an overdose.","Miglitol is not metabolized in man or in any animal species studied.","Absorption of miglitol is saturable at high doses with 25 mg being completely absorbed while a 100-mg dose is only 50-70% absorbed.

"DB00908","Quinidine","Quinidine is a D-isomer of [quinine] present in the bark of the Cinchona tree and similar plant species. This alkaloid was first described in 1848 and has a long history as an antiarrhythmic medication.[A38016,A250050] Quinidine is considered the first antiarrhythmic drug (class Ia) and is moderately efficacious in the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm.[A38016] It prolongs cellular action potential by blocking sodium and potassium currents. A phenomenon known as “quinidine syncope” was first described in the 1950s, characterized by syncopal attacks and ventricular fibrillation in patients treated with this drug.[A38016] Due to its side effects and increased risk of mortality, the use of quinidine was reduced over the next few decades. However, it continues to be used in the treatment of Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.[A250050]","324.183778022","Antiarrhythmics, class Ia","ANTIARRHYTHMICS, CLASS I AND III","CARDIAC THERAPY","CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM","Quinidine is indicated for the management and prophylactic therapy of atrial fibrillation/flutter, as well as the suppression of recurrent documented ventricular arrhythmias.[L42420,L3719] It is also used in the treatment of Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.[A250050,A250055].","Quinidine is an antimalarial schizonticide, and a class Ia antiarrhythmic agent used to interrupt or prevent reentrant arrhythmias and arrhythmias due to increased automaticity, such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.[L3719] In most patients, quinidine can lead to an increase in the sinus rate. Quinidine also causes a marked prolongation of the QT interval in a dose-related manner,[A38016,L42420] acts peripherally as an α-adrenergic antagonist, and has anticholinergic and negative inotropic activity.[L3719]

The QT interval prolongation caused by quinidine can lead to increased ventricular automaticity and polymorphic ventricular tachycardias, such as _torsades de pointes_. The risk of _torsades_ is increased by bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or high serum levels of quinidine. However, this type of rhythm disturbance may appear in the absence of any of them.[L42420,L3719] Patients treated with quinidine may also be at risk of a paradoxical increase in ventricular rate in atrial flutter/fibrillation, and patients with sick sinus syndrome treated with quinidine may develop marked sinus node depression and bradycardia.[L42420,L3719]","Quinidine has a complex electrophysiological profile that has not been fully elucidated. The antiarrhythmic actions of this drug are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers. Quinidine blocks the rapid sodium channel (I<sub>Na</sub>), decreasing the phase zero of rapid depolarization of the action potential.[A250050] Quinidine also reduces repolarizing K<sup>+</sup> currents (I<sub>Kr</sub>, I<sub>Ks</sub>), the inward rectifier potassium current (I<sub>K1</sub>), and the transient outward potassium current I<sub>to</sub>, as well as the L-type calcium current I<sub>Ca</sub> and the late I<sub>Na</sub> inward current.[A250050] The reduction of these currents leads to the prolongation of the action potential duration. By shortening the plateau but prolonging late depolarization, quinidine facilitates the formation of early afterdepolarisation (EAD).[A250050] Additionally, in patients with malaria, quinidine acts primarily as an intra-erythrocytic schizonticide, and is gametocidal to _Plasmodium vivax_ and _P. malariae_, but not to _P. falciparum_.[L42420,L3719]","Quinidine overdoses have been well described.

A gastric aspirate revealed that quinidine levels were 50 times higher than the ones detected in plasma. In cases of massive overdose, it may be appropriate to perform an endoscopy.[L42420] Acute quinidine overdoses are characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and hypotension.

The signs and symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation (i.e., abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, straining, and hard or lumpy stools) may be the result of abnormal colonic motility that can delay the transit of intestinal contents and impede the evacuation of rectal contents. One approach to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation is the secretion of fluid into the abdominal lumen through the activation of chloride channels in the apical membrane of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Lubiprostone is a locally acting chloride channel activator that increases intestinal chloride and fluid secretion without altering sodium and potassium concentrations in the serum.","Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium.","In a definitive Phase 1 cardiac repolarization study, 51 patients were administered a single oral dose of 144 mcg of lubiprostone, which is 6 times the normal single administration dose.

These biotransformations are not mediated by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system but rather appear to be mediated by the ubiquitously expressed carbonyl reductase. M3, a metabolite of lubiprostone in both humans and animals is formed by the reduction of the carbonyl group at the 15-hydroxy moiety that consists of both &alpha;-hydroxy and &beta;-hydroxy epimers. M3 makes up less than 10% of the dose of radiolabeled lubiprostone.","Lubiprostone has low systemic availability following oral administration and concentrations of lubiprostone in plasma are below the level of quantitation (10 pg/mL).","0.9 to 1.4 hours","94%","Peak plasma concentration was shown to be around 1.14 hours, with a majority of the drug excreted in the urine within 48 hours.

The drug was approved in Japan in 1994 for the treatment of diabetes, and it is under further investigation by Takeda for the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are oral anti-diabetic drugs used for diabetes mellitus type 2 that work by preventing the digestion of complex carbohydrates (such as starch). Complex carbohydrates are normally converted into simple sugars (monosaccharides) which can be absorbed through the intestine. Hence, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors reduce the impact of complex carbohydrates on blood sugar.","Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are saccharides that act as competitive inhibitors of enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates: specifically alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines. The membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Acarbose also blocks pancreatic alpha-amylase in addition to inhibiting membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drugs therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels: the long term effect is a small reduction in hemoglobin-A1c level.

"DB09280","Lumacaftor","Lumacaftor is a drug used in combination with [DB08820] as the fixed dose combination product Orkambi for the management of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, a transmembrane ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Mutations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the CFTR protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes.[A20298, A20299] As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition.[A20302] Lumacaftor improves CF symptoms and underlying disease pathology by aiding the conformational stability of F508del-mutated CFTR proteins, preventing misfolding and resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. 

Results from clinical trials indicated that treatment with Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) results in improved lung function, reduced chance of experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation, increased weight gain, and improvements in CF symptoms.[FDA Label] This data has been heavily scrutinized, however, with clinical trials showing only modest improvements despite a hefty yearly cost of $259,000 for Orkambi.[A20343] Improvements in lung function (ppFEV1) were found to be statistically significant, but minimal, with only a 2.6-3.0% change from baseline with more than 70% of patients failing to achieve an absolute improvement of at least 5%.[A20343, L936]

A wide variety of CFTR mutations correlate to the Cystic Fibrosis phenotype and are associated with differing levels of disease severity. The most common mutation, affecting approximately 70% of patients with CF worldwide, is known as F508del-CFTR, or delta-F508 (ΔF508), in which a deletion in the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 results in impaired production of the CFTR protein, thereby causing a significant reduction in the amount of ion transporter present on cell membranes.[A20301] When used in combination with [DB08820] as the fixed dose combination product Orkambi, lumacaftor is specific for the management of CF in patients with delta-F508 mutations as it acts as a protein-folding chaperone, aiding the conformational stability of the mutated CFTR protein. Consequently, lumacaftor increases successful production of CFTR ion channels and the total number of receptors available for use at the cell membrane for fluid and ion transport.[A18395] The next most common mutation, G551D, affecting 4-5% of CF patients worldwide, is characterized as a missense mutation, whereby there is sufficient amount of protein at the cell surface, but opening and closing mechanisms of the channel are altered.[A17564] Treatment of patients with G551D and other rarer missense mutations is usually managed with [DB08820] (Kalydeco), as it aids with altered gating mechanisms by potentiating channel opening probability of CFTR protein.

Prior to the development of lumacaftor and [DB08820] (Kalydeco), management of CF primarily involved therapies for the control of infections, nutritional support, clearance of mucus, and management of symptoms rather than improvements in the underlying disease process. Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by Health Canada in January 2016, Orkambi was the first combination product approved for the management of Cystic Fibrosis with delta-F508 mutations.

Nifurtimox, developed by Bayer, is a nitrofuran antiprotozoal drug used in the treatment of Chagas disease. On August 6 2020, accelerated FDA approval was granted for its use in pediatric patients in response to promising results from phase III clinical trials. Continued approval will be contingent upon confirmatory data.[L15361] A convenient feature of Bayer's formulation is the ability to divide the scored tablets manually without the need for pill-cutting devices.[L15361]","287.057591705","Nitrofuran derivatives","AGENTS AGAINST LEISHMANIASIS AND TRYPANOSOMIASIS","ANTIPROTOZOALS","ANTIPARASITIC PRODUCTS, INSECTICIDES AND REPELLENTS","Nifurtimox is indicated in pediatric patients under 18 weighing at least 2.5 kg.

Some symptoms of nifurtimox toxicity may include weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, headache, nervous excitation, insomnia, convulsions, drowsiness, arthralgias, myalgias, disorientation, abdominal pain, mucosal edema, and skin manifestations. These symptoms are adverse effects of nifurtimox and are likely to be exaggerated with increased exposure.[A217891]","Nifurtimox is largely metabolized via nitroreductase enzymes. Two major inactive metabolites have been identified: M-4 and M-6.   The M-4 metabolite is a cysteine conjugate of nifurtimox, while M-6 is likely formed by hydrolytic cleavage of the hydrazone moiety of nifurtimox.  Other minor metabolites have also been identified in human plasma.[A217986,L15361]","The average AUC of nifurtimox is estimated between 1676-2670 μg∙h/L.[L15361] One pharmacokinetic study of healthy volunteers revealed an AUC of 5430 ng∙ml<sup>-1</sup>∙h.[A217936] Cmax ranges between 425-568 μg/L (26–50%) after a single dose of 20 mg with food in adults.

Not only does favipiravir inhibit replication of influenza A and B, but the drug has shown promise in the treatment of avian influenza, and may be an alternative option for influenza strains that are resistant to neuramidase inhibitors.[A191721,L12090] Favipiravir has been investigated for the treatment of life-threatening pathogens such as Ebola virus, Lassa virus, and now COVID-19.[A191724,A191958,A191961]","157.028754544","Other antivirals","DIRECT ACTING ANTIVIRALS","ANTIVIRALS FOR SYSTEMIC USE","ANTIINFECTIVES FOR SYSTEMIC USE","In 2014, favipiravir was approved in Japan to treat cases of influenza that were unresponsive to conventional treatment.[A191721] Given its efficacy at targetting several strains of influenza, it has been investigated in other countries to treat novel viruses including Ebola and most recently, COVID-19.[A191688,A191724,L12012]","Favipiravir functions as a prodrug and undergoes ribosylation and phosphorylation intracellularly to become the active favipiravir-RTP.[A191688,A191724] Favipiravir-RTP binds to and inhibits RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which ultimately prevents viral transcription and replication.[A191688,A191691]","The mechanism of action of favipiravir is novel compared to existing influenza antivirals that primarily prevent entry and exit of the virus from cells.[A191688] The active favipiravir-RTP selectively inhibits RNA polymerase and prevents replication of the viral genome.[L12075] There are several hypotheses as to how favipiravir-RTP interacts with RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).[A191688] Some studies have shown that when favipiravir-RTP is incorporated into a nascent RNA strand, it prevents RNA strand elongation and viral proliferation.[A191688] Studies have also found that the presence of purine analogs can reduce favipiravir’s antiviral activity, suggesting competition between favipiravir-RTP and purine nucleosides for RdRp binding.[A191688]

Although favipiravir was originally developed to treat influenza, the RdRp catalytic domain (favipiravir's primary target), is expected to be similar for other RNA viruses.[A191688] This conserved RdRp catalytic domain contributes to favipiravir's broad-spectrum coverage.[A191688]","Based on single-dose toxicity studies, the lethal dose for oral and intravenous favipiravir in mice is estimated to be >2000 mg/kg.[L12075] In rats, the lethal dose for oral administration is  >2000 mg/kg, while the lethal dose in dogs and monkeys is  >1000 mg/kg.[L12075] Symptoms of overdose appear to include but are not limited to reduced body weight, vomiting, and decreased locomotor activity.[L12075]

In repeat-dose toxicity studies involving dogs, rats, and monkeys, notable findings after administration of oral favipiravir included: adverse effects on hematopoietic tissues such as decreased red blood cell (RBC) production, and increases in liver function parameters such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin, and increased vacuolization in hepatocytes.[L12075] Testis toxicity was also noted.[L12075]

Favipiravir is known to be teratogenic; therefore, administration of favipiravir should be avoided in women if pregnancy is confirmed or suspected.[A191688,A192066]

Toxicity information regarding favipiravir in humans is not readily available. ","Favipiravir is extensively metabolized with metabolites excreted mainly in the urine.[A191724] The antiviral undergoes hydroxylation primarily by aldehyde oxidase and to a lesser extent by xanthine oxidase to the inactive metabolite, T705M1.[A191724]","The bioavailability of favipiravir is almost complete at 97.6%.[L12075] The mean Cmax for the recommended dosing schedule of favipiravir is 51.5 ug/mL.[L12075]

Studies comparing the pharmacokinetic effects of multiple doses of favipiravir in healthy American and Japanese subjects are below:

When favipiravir was given as a single dose of 400 mg with food, the Cmax decreased.[L12075] It appears that when favipiravir is given at a higher dose or in multiple doses, irreversible inhibition of aldehyde oxidase (AO) occurs and the effect of food on the Cmax is lessened.[L12075]","The elimination half-life of favipiravir is estimated to range from 2 to 5.5 hours.[A191721]","Favipiravir is 54% plasma protein-bound.[A191721] Of this fraction, 65% is bound to serum albumin and 6.5% is bound to ɑ1-acid glycoprotein.[L12075]","Favipiravir's metabolites are predominantly renally cleared.[A191721]","The apparent volume of distribution of favipiravir is 15 - 20 L.[A191727]"

Otherwise, it is believed that bendazac also possesses non-steroidal anti-inflammatory actions, as well as analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory effects [L4782, T332] These effects may be accounted for in part by the substance's capability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity in converting arachidonic acid to cyclic endoperoxides - the precursors of prostaglandins [L4782, T332].

COX is essential for the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and F2 which are molecules derived from fatty acids and stored in the cell membrane.[T52] Acetometacine is metabolized and forms its major metabolite indometacin which is also a non-selective inhibitor of COX and exhibits the capacity to inhibit the motility of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and decreased cerebral flow by modulating the nitric oxide pathway and vasoconstriction.[T51]","The pharmacological activity of acemetacin causes blockage of prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandin is one of the mediators of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration thus, acemetacin causes a decreased renal function, transient renal insufficiency, interstitial nephritis and papillary necrosis especially in elderly patients, patients with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and impaired renal function.[T53]","Acemetacin is highly metabolized and degraded by esterolytic cleavage to form its major and active metabolite indometacin. It presents other inactive metabolites made by reaction of O-demethylation, N-desacylation and part of them are also transformed by conjugation with glucuronic acid.[T53]","After 8 days of oral administration twice daily of acemetacin there was an age-dependant Cmax of 276.8 ng/ml in elderly compared to 187 ng/ml for younger individuals. There was also a Tmax of 2.5 h and AUC in a range of 483-712 ng h/ml.[A31355] The bioavailability of acemetacin after repeated doses is aproximately 66% in plasma and 64% in urine.[A31356]","The elimination half-life of acemetacin after steady-state is 4.5 hours.[A31356]","Acemetacin is found highly bound to plasma proteins, reaching a percentage higher than 90% of the administered dose.[T53]","The elimination of acemetacin is divided in renal elimination that covers 40% of the complete administered dose and the restant 60% is excreted in feces.[T53]","The apparent volume of distribution of acemetacin is in a range of 0.5-0.7 L/kg.[T53]"
