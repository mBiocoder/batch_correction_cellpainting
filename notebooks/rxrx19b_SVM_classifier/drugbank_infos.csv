CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES","CARDIAC THERAPY","CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM","For the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH).","Midodrine is a prodrug, i.e., the therapeutic effect of orally administered midodrine is due to the major metabolite desglymidodrine formed by deglycination of midodrine. Administration of midodrine results in a rise in standing, sitting, and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with orthostatic hypotension of various etiologies. Standing systolic blood pressure is elevated by approximately 15 to 30 mmHg at 1 hour after a 10-mg dose of midodrine, with some effect persisting for 2 to 3 hours. Midodrine has no clinically significant effect on standing or supine pulse rates in patients with autonomic failure.","Midodrine undergoes metabolism to form its pharmacologically active metabolite, desglymidodrine. Desglymidodrine acts as an agonist at the alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors expressed in the arteriolar and venous vasculature. Activation of alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor signaling pathways lead to an increase in the vascular tone and elevation of blood pressure. Desglymidodrine is reported to have negligible effect on the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors.","Symptoms of overdose could include hypertension, piloerection (goosebumps), a sensation of coldness and urinary retention. The single doses that would be associated with symptoms of overdosage or would be potentially life- threatening are unknown. The oral LD<sub>50</sub> is approximately 30 to 50 mg/kg in rats, 675 mg/kg in mice, and 125 to 160 mg/kg in dogs. Desglymidodrine is dialyzable.","Thorough metabolic studies have not been conducted, but it appears that deglycination of midodrine to desglymidodrine takes place in many tissues, and both compounds are metabolized in part by the liver.","Rapidly absorbed following oral administration. The peak plasma concentrations of the prodrug, desglymidodrine, is reached about half an hour following drug administration. The metabolites reach their peak plasma concentrations at about 1 to 2 hours following drug administration. The absolute bioavailability of midodrine (measured as desglymidodrine) is 93% and is not affected by food. As desglymidodrine displays poor diffusibility across the blood-brain barrier, it is expected to have minimal effects on the central nervous system. ","The metabolites display a half-life of about 3 to 4 hours.","","",""

Atopic dermatitis is a skin condition characterized by redness, itching, scaling and inflammation of the skin. The cause of atopic dermatitis is not known; however, scientists believe that it may be due to activation of the immune system by various environmental or emotional triggers. Scientists do not know exactly how pimecrolimus reduces the manifestations of atopic dermatitis, but pimecrolimus reduces the action of T-cells and mast cells which are part of the immune system and contribute to responses of the immune system. Pimecrolimus prevents the activation of T-cells by blocking the effects of chemicals (cytokines) released by the body that stimulate T-cells. Pimecrolimus also reduces the ability of mast cells to release chemicals that promote inflammation.","Pimecrolimus binds with high affinity to macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12) and inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin.

It's analgesic properties make it a useful pain management tool across many settings including postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, menstrual disorders, headaches, spinal and soft tissue pain, and ankylosing spondylitis.[L6520] Impressively, ketorolac has a similar efficacy to standard doses of morphine and meperidine making it a useful opioid sparing agent.[L6511]","255.089543287","Antiinflammatory agents, non-steroids","ANTIINFLAMMATORY AGENTS","OPHTHALMOLOGICALS","SENSORY ORGANS","Ketorolac is a Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and has antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.[A176131]  It is indicated for short term management of acute pain that requires the calibre of pain management offered by opioids.[L3674]  Clinicians may choose to initiate ketorolac to manage post-operative pain, spinal and soft tissue pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, menstrual disorders and headaches among other ailments.[L6520] Regardless of the etiology of pain, patients should use the lowest possible dose, and avoid using ketorolac for an extended period of time (ideally ≤ 5 days).[L3674] A benefit of choosing ketorolac over other analgesics with similar potency is that that there does not appear to be a risk of dependence or tolerance with ketorolac use.[A176131]     ","Ketorolac is a non-selective NSAID and acts by inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes which are normally responsible for converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. The COX-1 enzyme is constitutively active and can be found in platelets, gastric mucosa, and vascular endothelium. On the other hand, the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and mediates inflammation, pain and fever.  

As a result, inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme is linked to an increased risk of bleeding and risk of gastric ulceration, while the desired anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties are linked to inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme.[A176134] Therefore, despite it's effectiveness in pain management, ketorolac should not be used long-term since this increases the risk of serious adverse effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, and perforations.[A178678]","Ketorolac inhibits key pathways in prostaglandin synthesis which is crucial to it's mechanism of action.[A176143]  Although ketorolac is non-selective and inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, it's clinical efficacy is derived from it's COX-2 inhibition. The COX-2 enzyme is inducible and is responsible for converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandins that mediate inflammation and pain.  By blocking this pathway, ketorolac achieves analgesia and reduces inflammation.[A176134] Ketorolac is administered as a racemic mixture; however, the ""S"" enantiomer is largely responsible for it's pharmacological activity.[A176246]","The rate of adverse effects increases with higher doses of ketorolac. The most frequently observed adverse effects in patients occurring with an incidence of greater than 10% include: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, and headaches.[L11055] Most adverse effects associated with short term use are mild in nature, related to the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system, and occur in roughly 39% of patients.[A176131] Common symptoms of ketorolac overdose include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, lethargy and drowsiness. More rare symptoms of overdose include acute renal failure, hypertension, respiratory depression, and coma.[L3674]

Ketorolac is classified as Pregnancy Category C since there is a lack of evidence demonstrating safety in pregnant women.[L11070] NSAIDs including ketorolac increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus in the 3rd trimester; therefore, beginning at 30 weeks gestation, pregnant women should avoid ketorolac.[L11070]

Ketorolac has been shown to be excreted in breast milk, and although available data has not demonstrated any adverse effects in nursing infants, practitioners should proceed with caution when suggesting ketorolac for nursing mothers.[L11055,L3674]  The benefits should outweigh the risks and the mother should be counselled to monitor the infant closely and to contact the infant's healthcare provider should any adverse effects arise.[L11055,L3674]

"DB00481","Raloxifene","Raloxifene is a second generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that mediates anti-estrogenic effects on breast and uterine tissues, and estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood coagulation.[A4979,T28] Exhibiting tissue-specific effects distinct from [estradiol], raloxifene is the first of the benzothiophene group of antiestrogens to be labelled a SERM.[A4977] Available in many countries worldwide, raloxifene was initially approved by the FDA in December, 1997 under the market name Evista® for the management and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and reduction in risk for invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or those who are at high risk for invasive breast cancer. However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]

The main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]","473.166079047","Selective estrogen receptor modulators","OTHER SEX HORMONES AND MODULATORS OF THE GENITAL SYSTEM","SEX HORMONES AND MODULATORS OF THE GENITAL SYSTEM","GENITO URINARY SYSTEM AND SEX HORMONES","Indicated for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, as well as prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced bone loss.[label]

Indicated for the reduction in the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or postmenopausal women with a high risk for invasive breast cancer.[label]","Raloxifene belongs to the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) drug class that exhibits estrogenic effects on bone and lipid metabolism while mediating anti-estrogenic effects on uterine endometrium and breast tissues.[A4977] On skeletal tissues, raloxifene stimulates bone-depositing osteoblasts and inhibits bone-resorbing osteoclasts[T28] to augument bone mineral density.[A4977] Raloxifene produces estrogen-like effects on bone, reducing the resorption of bone and increasing bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, thus slowing the rate of bone loss.[label] In three randomized, placebo-controlled trials in Europe, postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene at variable doses of 30 to 150 mg daily demonstrated significant increases in bone mineral density in the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and total body compared to placebo.[A4977] In the MORE and RUTH trials, there were fewer incidences of vertebral fractures in postmeopausal women receiving raloxifene compared to placebo.[A4979] In a eight-week study evaluating short-term effects of raloxifene in healthy postmenopausal women, there was a decrease in the bone turnover markers, such as serum alkaline phosphatase level, serum osteocalcin level and urinary calcium excretion.[A4977] 

Raloxifene was shown to inhibit estrogen-dependent proliferation of human breast cancer cells _in vitro_ and development of induced mammary tumors in rats _in vivo_.[A721] In adult female rats, raloxifene produced a greater regression of the mammary gland than [tamoxifen].[A721] The MORE trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial that investigated the long-term effects of the drug therapy in European and American postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene for 40 months.[A719] Additionally, a reduction in the incidence of invasive breast cancer was also demonstrates in the CORE and RUTH trials.[A4979] Study findings demonstrated that compared to placebo, the risk of invasive breast cancer was decreased by 76% among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. There was a decrease in the risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 90% but there was no increase in the risk of endometrial cancer. Unlike hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene does not mediate proliferative or stimulatory effects on endometrial tissue. Findings from both animal and human studies demonstrated no significant changes in the histologic appearance of the endometrium.[A4977]

Raloxifene promotes estrogen-like effects on lipid metabolism. In a European trial that evaluated lipid profiles following raloxifene therapy over the 24-month period, there were significant decreases in the serum concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol over a 24-month period of raloxifene therapy.[A4977] Raloxifene is not associated with causing alterations in the serum levels of HDL cholesterol or triglycerides.[A4977] As the HDL choesterol level is considered a strong inverse predictor of cardiovascular disease in women, the cardioprotective effects of raloxifene were questioned. Due to limited data on the long-term trials, it is not possible to determine whether the small lipid effects produced by raloxifene correlate with a smaller degree of cardioprotective activity compared with hormone replacement therapy.[A4977] ","Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as both an estrogen agonist and antagonist via differential effects on the tissue-specific estrogen receptors. Based on the findings of competitive binding assays, raloxifene displays binding affinity that is similar to that of [estradiol][A721], the predominant circulating estrogen.[A178861] Estrogens play variable roles at different tissues in females, including the bone, breasts, uterus and liver, by binding to the steroid nuclear hormone receptors, Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) or Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ).[A178861] These receptors are normally bound to the Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) when unbound to the ligand. Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that promotes dissociation of the receptor from Hsp90, dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. This movement into the nucleus allows the receptor to bind to genomic locations based on sequence recognition of the DNA binding domain, also known as the Estrogen Response Elements (EREs).[A178861] 

In bones, endogenous estrogens normally modulate multiple DNA response elements, including the gene-encoding transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3), which is a cytokine embedded in the bone matrix.[T28] TGF-β3 plays an important role in bone remodelling[A178756] by working with other cytokines to induce production of osteoblasts, such as IL-6[A720], and attenuate the activity of osetoclasts. Estrogens typically maintain the bone integrity by inhibiting the cytokines that recruit osteoclasts and oppose the bone-resorbing, Ca2+-mobilizing action of parathyroid hormone. In contrast, estrogens promote osteoblast proliferation, augment the production of TGF-β3 and bone morphogenic proteins, and inhibit apoptosis.[T28] Mimicking the action of endogenous estrogen in bone tissues, raloxifene binds to the estrogen receptor to influence gene transcription through interactions with the estrogen response element (ERE) and a distinct DNA target, the raloxifene response element (RRE).[A722] It occupies the same ER ligand binding site as estrogen.[A724] Upon binding, raloxifene induces a conformational change of the receptor, allowing mediation of direct binding to transcriptional elements by accessory proteins. Increased expression of bone matrix proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, osteocalcin and collagen may be seen.[A722] The agonistic or antagonistic action of raloxifene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promotors.[label] In breast tissues, raloxifene acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist to attenuate the estrogen-dependent proliferative effects of epithelial cell expansion. In addition to the antiproliferative effects, raloxifene prevents the production of cytokines and recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes into tumor mass.[A178921]","**LD<sub>50</sub> and Overdose**

The oral LD<sub>50</sub> value in rats is > 5000 mg/kg, which is about 810 times the human dose.[MSDS] In monkeys, no mortality was seen after a single oral dose of 1000 mg/kg.[label] No cases of raloxifene overdose have been reported during clinical trials. A rare postmarketing report of a non-fatal overdose after oral ingestion of 1.5 g has been reported. Common adverse events of leg cramps, hot flushes, and dizziness have been reported with the use of raloxifene at doses of greater than 180 mg. More serious adverse event of venous thromboembolic events were observed with raloxifene.[A721] Two 18-month-old children accidentally ingested 180 mg of raloxifene and symptoms of ataxia, dizziness, vomiting, rash, diarrhea, tremor, flushing, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels were reported. There is no known antidote for raloxifene. [label] 

**Nonclinical Toxicology**

In a two-year mouse carcinogenicity study at raloxifene doses that are higher than the human therapeutic doses, there was an increased incidence of benign and malignant ovarian tumors of granulosa or theca cell origin. Another study showed an increased incidence of testicular interstitial cell tumors, prostatic adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and prostatic leiomyoblastoma in male mice receiving doses higher than human therapeutic doses. There was no evidence of the genotoxic potential of raloxifene in bacterial mutagenicity assays, _in vitro_ rat DNA assays, or other _in vitro_ rodent cell line assays. When assessing effects on the reproductive system of male and female rats, raloxifene caused lack of pregnancy and disruptions in estrous cycles and inhibited ovulation at dose of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day. Administration of raloxifene during the preimplantation period at doses greater than 0.1 mg/kg resulted in delayed and disrupted embryo implantation, further leading to prolonged gestation and reduced litter size. There were no effects on sperm production or quality or reproductive performance in male rats. The effects on the fertility by raloxifene were reversible.[label] 

**Use in special populations**

The use of raloxifene in pregnant or nursing women is not advised. Although there are no specific dosing adjustment guidelines, caution should be undertaken when administering raloxifene in geriatric patients or patients with renal or hepatic impairment.[label]","Raloxifene is reported to undergo metabolism in the intestines and liver devoid of cytochrome P450 pathway.[A4977] It is extensively metabolized, where less than 1% of the total dose exists as unchanged compound.[label] It mainly undergoes first-pass metabolism to form glucuronide conjugates, raloxifene-4'-glucuronide (raloxifene-4'-β-glucuronide), raloxifene-6-glucuronide (raloxifene-6-β-glucuronide), and raloxifene-6,4'-diglucuronide. No other metabolites have been detected in human plasma. The terminal log-linear portions of the plasma concentration curves for raloxifene and the glucuronides are generally parallel. This is consistent with interconversion of raloxifene and the glucuronide metabolites.[label]","Raloxifene is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with approximately 60% fo the drug being absorbed following oral administration.[T28] Due to the extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism that involves glucuronide conjugation, the absolute oral bioavailability of raloxifene is about 2%.[T28] Following oral ingestion of a single dose or multiple dose of raloxifen in healthy postmenopausal women, the mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were 0.50 and 1.36 ng/mL, respectively, and the AUC values were 27.2 and 24.2 ngxhr/mL, respectively. The time to reach Cmax following a single or multiple oral doses were 27.7 and 32.5 hours, respectively.[label] Although not clinically significant, oral ingestion of raloxifene with high-fat meals is thought to increase the systemic bioavailability of the drug[A4977] by increasnig the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and AUC by 28% and 16%, respectively.[label]","The average plasma elimination half-life of raloxifene ranges from 27 to 32 hours.[A4977,T28] The prolonged half-life has been attributed to the drug's reversible systemic metabolism and significant enterohepatic cycling.[A4977]","About 95% of raloxifene and its glucuronide metabolites are bound to plasma proteins.[label] Although this is a relatively high protein binding profile, _in vitro_ studies suggest that raloxifene and its metabolites do not significantly interact with binding of highly protein-bound drugs.[A4977] FDA Label still advises patients to use raloxifene with caution co-administering with other highly protein-bound drugs.[label]","Raloxifene predominantly undergoes fecal excretion, with less than 0.2% of the dose being excreted in the urine as unchanged form of the compound and less than 6% of the dose being excreted as glucuronide conjugates.

As a consequence of plasma glucose reduction, miglitol reduce levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in patients with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Systemic nonenzymatic protein glycosylation, as reflected by levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, is a function of average blood glucose concentration over time. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of miglitol to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas when used in combination. In addition, miglitol diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Miglitol has minor inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently, at the recommended doses, would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.","In contrast to sulfonylureas, miglitol does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of miglitol results from a reversible inhibition of membrane-bound intestinal a-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Membrane-bound intestinal a-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in delayed glucose absorption and lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia.","Unlike sulfonylureas or insulin, an overdose will not result in hypoglycemia.

A prostaglandin E1 derivative, lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid that activates ClC-2 chloride channels located on the apical side of the gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Activation of these channels promotes the secretion of a chloride-rich fluid that soften the stool, increase gastrointestinal motility, and induce spontaneous bowel movements (SBM).","390.221780456","Other drugs for constipation","DRUGS FOR CONSTIPATION","DRUGS FOR CONSTIPATION","ALIMENTARY TRACT AND METABOLISM","Lubiprostone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic idiopathic constipation, or opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic non-cancer pain.[L4421] It is also indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in female patients ≥18 years old.[L4421]","Chronic idiopathic constipation is generally defined by infrequent or difficult passage of stool. The signs and symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation (i.e., abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, straining, and hard or lumpy stools) may be the result of abnormal colonic motility that can delay the transit of intestinal contents and impede the evacuation of rectal contents. One approach to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation is the secretion of fluid into the abdominal lumen through the activation of chloride channels in the apical membrane of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Lubiprostone is a locally acting chloride channel activator that increases intestinal chloride and fluid secretion without altering sodium and potassium concentrations in the serum.","Lubiprostone acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels, which is a normal constituent of the apical membrane of the human intestine, in a protein kinase A action independent fashion. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium.","In a definitive Phase 1 cardiac repolarization study, 51 patients were administered a single oral dose of 144 mcg of lubiprostone, which is 6 times the normal single administration dose. Thirty-nine (39) of the 51 patients experienced an adverse event. The adverse events reported in >1% of this group included the following: nausea (45.1%), vomiting (27.5%), diarrhea (25.5%), dizziness (17.6%), loose or watery stools (13.7%), headache (11.8%), retching (7.8%), abdominal pain (5.9%), flushing or hot flush (5.9%), dyspnea (3.9%), pallor (3.9%), stomach discomfort (3.9%), syncope (3.9%), upper abdominal pain (2.0%), anorexia (2.0%), asthenia (2.0%), chest discomfort (2.0%), dry mouth (2.0%), hyperhidrosis (2.0%), skin irritation (2.0%) and vasovagal episode (2.0%).","The results of both human and animal studies indicate that lubiprostone is rapidly and extensively metabolized by 15-position reduction, &alpha;-chain &beta;-oxidation, and &omega;-chain &omega;-oxidation. These biotransformations are not mediated by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system but rather appear to be mediated by the ubiquitously expressed carbonyl reductase. M3, a metabolite of lubiprostone in both humans and animals is formed by the reduction of the carbonyl group at the 15-hydroxy moiety that consists of both &alpha;-hydroxy and &beta;-hydroxy epimers. M3 makes up less than 10% of the dose of radiolabeled lubiprostone.","Lubiprostone has low systemic availability following oral administration and concentrations of lubiprostone in plasma are below the level of quantitation (10 pg/mL).","0.9 to 1.4 hours","94%","Peak plasma concentration was shown to be around 1.14 hours, with a majority of the drug excreted in the urine within 48 hours.  Lubiprostone and M3 are only detected in trace amounts in human feces.",""
"DB01076","Atorvastatin","Atorvastatin (Lipitor®), is a lipid-lowering drug included in the statin class of medications. By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]","558.253000445","Combinations of various lipid modifying agents","LIPID MODIFYING AGENTS, COMBINATIONS","LIPID MODIFYING AGENTS","CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM","Atorvastatin is indicated for the treatment of several types of dyslipidemias, including primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia in adults, hypertriglyceridemia, primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in adolescent patients with failed dietary modifications.[A177397]

Dyslipidemia describes an elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides or both as well as to the presence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein. This condition represents an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis.[L6025] 

Atorvastatin is indicated, in combination with dietary modifications, to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiac risk factors and/or abnormal lipid profiles.[A177397]

Atorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease but multiple risk factors.[A177397]

Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.[A177397]

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]","Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 

Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]

**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**

Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]

**Liver Dysfunction**

Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]

**Endocrine Effects**

Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]

**Cardiovascular**

Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]

**Lipoprotein A**

In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]","Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). 

_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]","The reported LD50 of oral atorvastatin in mice is higher than 5000 mg/kg.[MSDS] In cases of overdose with atorvastatin, there is reported symptoms of complicated breathing, jaundice, liver damage, dark urine, muscle pain, and seizures.[L6031] In case of overdose, symptomatic treatment is recommended and due to the high plasma protein binding, hemodialysis is not expected to generate significant improvement.[FDA label]

In carcinogenic studies with high doses of atorvastatin, evidence of rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, liver adenoma, and liver carcinoma were observed.[FDA label]

In fertility studies with high doses of atorvastatin, there were events of aplasia, aspermia, low testis and epididymal weight, decreased sperm motility, decreased spermatid head concentration and increased abnormal sperm.[FDA label]

After the administration of a dose of 40 mg, its peak plasma concentration of 28 ng/ml is reached 1-2 hours after initial administration with an AUC of about 200 ng∙h/ml.[A177478] Atorvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the wall of the gut and the liver, resulting in an absolute oral bioavailability of 14%.[A177397] Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration.[F4670]

Administration of atorvastatin with food results in prolonged Tmax and a reduction in Cmax and AUC.[A177415]

Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) is a membrane-bound protein that plays an important role in the absorption of atorvastatin.[A181460] Evidence from pharmacogenetic studies of c.421C>A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene for BCRP has demonstrated that individuals with the 421AA genotype have reduced functional activity and 1.72-fold higher AUC for atorvastatin compared to study individuals with the control 421CC genotype. This has important implications for the variation in response to the drug in terms of efficacy and toxicity, particularly as the BCRP c.421C>A polymorphism occurs more frequently in Asian populations than in Caucasians.[A181478, A181487] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include [fluvastatin], [simvastatin], and [rosuvastatin].[A181478]

This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]","558.253000445","Lipid modifying agents in combination with other drugs","LIPID MODIFYING AGENTS, COMBINATIONS","LIPID MODIFYING AGENTS","CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM","Atorvastatin is indicated for the treatment of several types of dyslipidemias, including primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia in adults, hypertriglyceridemia, primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in adolescent patients with failed dietary modifications.[A177397]

Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.[A177397]

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]","Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 

Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]

**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**

Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]

**Liver Dysfunction**

Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]

**Endocrine Effects**

Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]

**Cardiovascular**

Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]

**Lipoprotein A**

In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]","Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). 

_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]","The reported LD50 of oral atorvastatin in mice is higher than 5000 mg/kg.[MSDS] In cases of overdose with atorvastatin, there is reported symptoms of complicated breathing, jaundice, liver damage, dark urine, muscle pain, and seizures.[L6031] In case of overdose, symptomatic treatment is recommended and due to the high plasma protein binding, hemodialysis is not expected to generate significant improvement.[FDA label]

In carcinogenic studies with high doses of atorvastatin, evidence of rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, liver adenoma, and liver carcinoma were observed.[FDA label]

In fertility studies with high doses of atorvastatin, there were events of aplasia, aspermia, low testis and epididymal weight, decreased sperm motility, decreased spermatid head concentration and increased abnormal sperm.[FDA label]

Atorvastatin was shown to not be mutagenic in diverse mutagenic assays.[FDA label]","Atorvastatin is highly metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products, primarily by Cytochrome P450 3A4 in the intestine and liver.[F4670,F4673] Atorvastatin's metabolites undergo further lactonization via the formation of acyl glucuronide intermediates by the enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. These lactones can be hydrolyzed back to their corresponding acid forms and exist in equilibirum.[A19474,A181460]

_In vitro_ inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites.[F4670,F4673]","Atorvastatin presents a dose-dependent and non-linear pharmacokinetic profile.[A177436] It is very rapidly absorbed after oral administration. After the administration of a dose of 40 mg, its peak plasma concentration of 28 ng/ml is reached 1-2 hours after initial administration with an AUC of about 200 ng∙h/ml.[A177478] Atorvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the wall of the gut and the liver, resulting in an absolute oral bioavailability of 14%.[A177397] Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration.[F4670]

Administration of atorvastatin with food results in prolonged Tmax and a reduction in Cmax and AUC.[A177415]

Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) is a membrane-bound protein that plays an important role in the absorption of atorvastatin.[A181460] Evidence from pharmacogenetic studies of c.421C>A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene for BCRP has demonstrated that individuals with the 421AA genotype have reduced functional activity and 1.72-fold higher AUC for atorvastatin compared to study individuals with the control 421CC genotype. This has important implications for the variation in response to the drug in terms of efficacy and toxicity, particularly as the BCRP c.421C>A polymorphism occurs more frequently in Asian populations than in Caucasians.[A181478, A181487] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include [fluvastatin], [simvastatin], and [rosuvastatin].[A181478]

Genetic differences in the OATP1B1 (organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1) hepatic transporter encoded by the SCLCO1B1 gene (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter family member 1B1) have been shown to impact atorvastatin pharmacokinetics.

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]","558.253000445","HMG CoA reductase inhibitors","LIPID MODIFYING AGENTS, PLAIN","LIPID MODIFYING AGENTS","CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM","Atorvastatin is indicated for the treatment of several types of dyslipidemias, including primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia in adults, hypertriglyceridemia, primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in adolescent patients with failed dietary modifications.[A177397]

Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.[A177397]

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]","Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 

Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]

**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**

Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]

**Liver Dysfunction**

Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]

**Endocrine Effects**

Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]

**Cardiovascular**

Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]

**Lipoprotein A**

In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]","Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). 

_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]","The reported LD50 of oral atorvastatin in mice is higher than 5000 mg/kg.[MSDS] In cases of overdose with atorvastatin, there is reported symptoms of complicated breathing, jaundice, liver damage, dark urine, muscle pain, and seizures.[L6031] In case of overdose, symptomatic treatment is recommended and due to the high plasma protein binding, hemodialysis is not expected to generate significant improvement.[FDA label]

In carcinogenic studies with high doses of atorvastatin, evidence of rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, liver adenoma, and liver carcinoma were observed.[FDA label]

In fertility studies with high doses of atorvastatin, there were events of aplasia, aspermia, low testis and epididymal weight, decreased sperm motility, decreased spermatid head concentration and increased abnormal sperm.[FDA label]

Atorvastatin was shown to not be mutagenic in diverse mutagenic assays.[FDA label]","Atorvastatin is highly metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products, primarily by Cytochrome P450 3A4 in the intestine and liver.[F4670,F4673] Atorvastatin's metabolites undergo further lactonization via the formation of acyl glucuronide intermediates by the enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. These lactones can be hydrolyzed back to their corresponding acid forms and exist in equilibirum.[A19474,A181460]

_In vitro_ inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of atorvastatin.

After the administration of a dose of 40 mg, its peak plasma concentration of 28 ng/ml is reached 1-2 hours after initial administration with an AUC of about 200 ng∙h/ml.[A177478] Atorvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the wall of the gut and the liver, resulting in an absolute oral bioavailability of 14%.[A177397] Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration.[F4670]

Administration of atorvastatin with food results in prolonged Tmax and a reduction in Cmax and AUC.[A177415]

Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) is a membrane-bound protein that plays an important role in the absorption of atorvastatin.[A181460] Evidence from pharmacogenetic studies of c.421C>A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene for BCRP has demonstrated that individuals with the 421AA genotype have reduced functional activity and 1.72-fold higher AUC for atorvastatin compared to study individuals with the control 421CC genotype. This has important implications for the variation in response to the drug in terms of efficacy and toxicity, particularly as the BCRP c.421C>A polymorphism occurs more frequently in Asian populations than in Caucasians.[A181478, A181487] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include [fluvastatin], [simvastatin], and [rosuvastatin].[A181478]

Genetic differences in the OATP1B1 (organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1) hepatic transporter encoded by the SCLCO1B1 gene (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter family member 1B1) have been shown to impact atorvastatin pharmacokinetics. Evidence from pharmacogenetic studies of the c.521T>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) demonstrated that atorvastatin AUC was increased 2.45-fold for individuals homozygous for 521CC compared to homozygous 521TT individuals.[A181493] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include [simvastatin], [pitavastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pravastatin].[A181460]","The half-life of atorvastatin is 14 hours while the half-life of its metabolites can reach up to 30 hours.[F4670,F4673]","Atorvastatin is highly bound to plasma proteins and over 98% of the administered dose is found in a bound form.[F4670,F4673]","Atorvastatin and its metabolites are mainly eliminated in the bile without enterohepatic recirculation.

Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.[A177397]

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]","Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 

Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]

**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**

Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]

**Liver Dysfunction**

Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]

**Endocrine Effects**

Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]

**Cardiovascular**

Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]

**Lipoprotein A**

In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]","Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). 

_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]","The reported LD50 of oral atorvastatin in mice is higher than 5000 mg/kg.[MSDS] In cases of overdose with atorvastatin, there is reported symptoms of complicated breathing, jaundice, liver damage, dark urine, muscle pain, and seizures.[L6031] In case of overdose, symptomatic treatment is recommended and due to the high plasma protein binding, hemodialysis is not expected to generate significant improvement.[FDA label]

In carcinogenic studies with high doses of atorvastatin, evidence of rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, liver adenoma, and liver carcinoma were observed.[FDA label]

In fertility studies with high doses of atorvastatin, there were events of aplasia, aspermia, low testis and epididymal weight, decreased sperm motility, decreased spermatid head concentration and increased abnormal sperm.[FDA label]

Atorvastatin was shown to not be mutagenic in diverse mutagenic assays.[FDA label]","Atorvastatin is highly metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products, primarily by Cytochrome P450 3A4 in the intestine and liver.[F4670,F4673] Atorvastatin's metabolites undergo further lactonization via the formation of acyl glucuronide intermediates by the enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. These lactones can be hydrolyzed back to their corresponding acid forms and exist in equilibirum.[A19474,A181460]

_In vitro_ inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of atorvastatin.

After the administration of a dose of 40 mg, its peak plasma concentration of 28 ng/ml is reached 1-2 hours after initial administration with an AUC of about 200 ng∙h/ml.[A177478] Atorvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the wall of the gut and the liver, resulting in an absolute oral bioavailability of 14%.[A177397] Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration.[F4670]

Administration of atorvastatin with food results in prolonged Tmax and a reduction in Cmax and AUC.[A177415]

Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) is a membrane-bound protein that plays an important role in the absorption of atorvastatin.[A181460] Evidence from pharmacogenetic studies of c.421C>A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene for BCRP has demonstrated that individuals with the 421AA genotype have reduced functional activity and 1.72-fold higher AUC for atorvastatin compared to study individuals with the control 421CC genotype. This has important implications for the variation in response to the drug in terms of efficacy and toxicity, particularly as the BCRP c.421C>A polymorphism occurs more frequently in Asian populations than in Caucasians.[A181478, A181487] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include [fluvastatin], [simvastatin], and [rosuvastatin].[A181478]

Genetic differences in the OATP1B1 (organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1) hepatic transporter encoded by the SCLCO1B1 gene (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter family member 1B1) have been shown to impact atorvastatin pharmacokinetics.

Atorvastatin is indicated, in combination with dietary modifications, to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiac risk factors and/or abnormal lipid profiles.[A177397]

Atorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease but multiple risk factors.[A177397]

Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.[A177397]

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]","Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 

Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]

**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**

Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]

**Liver Dysfunction**

Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]

**Endocrine Effects**

Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]

**Cardiovascular**

Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]

**Lipoprotein A**

In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]","Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). 

_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]","The reported LD50 of oral atorvastatin in mice is higher than 5000 mg/kg.[MSDS] In cases of overdose with atorvastatin, there is reported symptoms of complicated breathing, jaundice, liver damage, dark urine, muscle pain, and seizures.[L6031] In case of overdose, symptomatic treatment is recommended and due to the high plasma protein binding, hemodialysis is not expected to generate significant improvement.[FDA label]

In carcinogenic studies with high doses of atorvastatin, evidence of rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, liver adenoma, and liver carcinoma were observed.[FDA label]

In fertility studies with high doses of atorvastatin, there were events of aplasia, aspermia, low testis and epididymal weight, decreased sperm motility, decreased spermatid head concentration and increased abnormal sperm.[FDA label]

Atorvastatin was shown to not be mutagenic in diverse mutagenic assays.[FDA label]","Atorvastatin is highly metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products, primarily by Cytochrome P450 3A4 in the intestine and liver.[F4670,F4673] Atorvastatin's metabolites undergo further lactonization via the formation of acyl glucuronide intermediates by the enzymes UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. These lactones can be hydrolyzed back to their corresponding acid forms and exist in equilibirum.[A19474,A181460]

_In vitro_ inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites.[F4670,F4673]","Atorvastatin presents a dose-dependent and non-linear pharmacokinetic profile.[A177436] It is very rapidly absorbed after oral administration. After the administration of a dose of 40 mg, its peak plasma concentration of 28 ng/ml is reached 1-2 hours after initial administration with an AUC of about 200 ng∙h/ml.[A177478] Atorvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the wall of the gut and the liver, resulting in an absolute oral bioavailability of 14%.[A177397] Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration.[F4670]

Administration of atorvastatin with food results in prolonged Tmax and a reduction in Cmax and AUC.[A177415]

Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) is a membrane-bound protein that plays an important role in the absorption of atorvastatin.[A181460] Evidence from pharmacogenetic studies of c.421C>A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene for BCRP has demonstrated that individuals with the 421AA genotype have reduced functional activity and 1.72-fold higher AUC for atorvastatin compared to study individuals with the control 421CC genotype. This has important implications for the variation in response to the drug in terms of efficacy and toxicity, particularly as the BCRP c.421C>A polymorphism occurs more frequently in Asian populations than in Caucasians.[A181478, A181487] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include [fluvastatin], [simvastatin], and [rosuvastatin].[A181478]

Genetic differences in the OATP1B1 (organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1) hepatic transporter encoded by the SCLCO1B1 gene (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter family member 1B1) have been shown to impact atorvastatin pharmacokinetics. Evidence from pharmacogenetic studies of the c.521T>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene encoding OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) demonstrated that atorvastatin AUC was increased 2.45-fold for individuals homozygous for 521CC compared to homozygous 521TT individuals.[A181493] Other statin drugs impacted by this polymorphism include [simvastatin], [pitavastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pravastatin].[A181460]","The half-life of atorvastatin is 14 hours while the half-life of its metabolites can reach up to 30 hours.[F4670,F4673]","Atorvastatin is highly bound to plasma proteins and over 98% of the administered dose is found in a bound form.[F4670,F4673]","Atorvastatin and its metabolites are mainly eliminated in the bile without enterohepatic recirculation. The renal elimination of atorvastatin is very minimal and represents less than 1% of the eliminated dose.[F4670,F4673]","The reported volume of distribution of atorvastatin is of 380 L.[F4670,F4673]"

","Aceclofenac is a NSAID that inhibits both isoforms of COX enzyme, a key enzyme involved in the inflammatory cascade. COX-1 enzyme is a constitutive enzyme involved in prostacyclin production and protective functions of gastric mucosa whereas COX-2 is an inducible enzyme involved in the production of inflammatory mediators in response to inflammatory stimuli. Aceclofenac displays more selectivity towards COX-2 (IC50 of 0.77uM) than COX-1 (IC50 of >100uM), which promotes its gastric tolerance compared to other NSAIDs. The primary metabolite, 4'-hydroxyaceclofenac, also minimally inhibits COX-2 with IC50 value of 36uM [A19667]. Although the mode of action of aceclofenac is thought to mainly arise from the inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins (PGE2), aceclofenac also inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines, interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6), and tumor necrosis factors (TNF) [A19666, A19667].

Aceclofenac is shown to decreased production of nitrous oxide in human articular chondrocytes [A19667]. In addition, aceclofenac interferes with neutrophil adhesion to endothelium by decreasing the expression of L-selectin (CD62L), which is a cell adhesion molecule expressed on lymphocytes [A19673].

"DB09280","Lumacaftor","Lumacaftor is a drug used in combination with [DB08820] as the fixed dose combination product Orkambi for the management of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, a transmembrane ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Mutations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the CFTR protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes.[A20298, A20299] As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition.[A20302] Lumacaftor improves CF symptoms and underlying disease pathology by aiding the conformational stability of F508del-mutated CFTR proteins, preventing misfolding and resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. 

Results from clinical trials indicated that treatment with Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) results in improved lung function, reduced chance of experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation, increased weight gain, and improvements in CF symptoms.[FDA Label] This data has been heavily scrutinized, however, with clinical trials showing only modest improvements despite a hefty yearly cost of $259,000 for Orkambi.[A20343] Improvements in lung function (ppFEV1) were found to be statistically significant, but minimal, with only a 2.6-3.0% change from baseline with more than 70% of patients failing to achieve an absolute improvement of at least 5%.[A20343, L936]

A wide variety of CFTR mutations correlate to the Cystic Fibrosis phenotype and are associated with differing levels of disease severity. The most common mutation, affecting approximately 70% of patients with CF worldwide, is known as F508del-CFTR, or delta-F508 (ΔF508), in which a deletion in the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 results in impaired production of the CFTR protein, thereby causing a significant reduction in the amount of ion transporter present on cell membranes.[A20301] When used in combination with [DB08820] as the fixed dose combination product Orkambi, lumacaftor is specific for the management of CF in patients with delta-F508 mutations as it acts as a protein-folding chaperone, aiding the conformational stability of the mutated CFTR protein. Consequently, lumacaftor increases successful production of CFTR ion channels and the total number of receptors available for use at the cell membrane for fluid and ion transport.[A18395] The next most common mutation, G551D, affecting 4-5% of CF patients worldwide, is characterized as a missense mutation, whereby there is sufficient amount of protein at the cell surface, but opening and closing mechanisms of the channel are altered.[A17564] Treatment of patients with G551D and other rarer missense mutations is usually managed with [DB08820] (Kalydeco), as it aids with altered gating mechanisms by potentiating channel opening probability of CFTR protein.

Prostaglandin is one of the mediators of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration thus, acemetacin causes a decreased renal function, transient renal insufficiency, interstitial nephritis and papillary necrosis especially in elderly patients, patients with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and impaired renal function.[T53]","Acemetacin is highly metabolized and degraded by esterolytic cleavage to form its major and active metabolite indometacin. It presents other inactive metabolites made by reaction of O-demethylation, N-desacylation and part of them are also transformed by conjugation with glucuronic acid.[T53]","After 8 days of oral administration twice daily of acemetacin there was an age-dependant Cmax of 276.8 ng/ml in elderly compared to 187 ng/ml for younger individuals. There was also a Tmax of 2.5 h and AUC in a range of 483-712 ng h/ml.[A31355] The bioavailability of acemetacin after repeated doses is aproximately 66% in plasma and 64% in urine.[A31356]","The elimination half-life of acemetacin after steady-state is 4.5 hours.[A31356]","Acemetacin is found highly bound to plasma proteins, reaching a percentage higher than 90% of the administered dose.[T53]","The elimination of acemetacin is divided in renal elimination that covers 40% of the complete administered dose and the restant 60% is excreted in feces.[T53]","The apparent volume of distribution of acemetacin is in a range of 0.5-0.7 L/kg.[T53]"
